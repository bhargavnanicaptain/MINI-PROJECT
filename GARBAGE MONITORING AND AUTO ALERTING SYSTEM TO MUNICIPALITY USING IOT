Chapter 1: Introduction

1.1 Introduction to Embedded Systems

Embedded systems are computer systems that are designed to perform specific tasks. They are used in a wide range of applications, from portable devices like smartphones to large-scale systems like traffic lights, factory controllers, or the systems controlling nuclear power plants. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are optimized for specific tasks, reducing the size and cost of the product.

1.2 Definition of Embedded Systems

An embedded system is a special-purpose computer system that is used for a particular task. It is built around a microprocessor, microcontroller, or digital signal processor and is designed to perform specific functions.

1.3 Existing System

The existing system for waste management involves manual monitoring of waste bins, which is a cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time, and cost.

1.4 Drawbacks of Existing System

The existing system for waste management has several drawbacks, including:

Inefficient waste collection
High labor costs
Lack of real-time monitoring
Inability to predict waste levels
1.5 Proposed System

The proposed system is an IoT-based garbage monitoring and auto-alerting system to municipalities. The system uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the level of garbage and sends alerts to the local municipalities through the Blynking IOT app when the garbage level is high.

1.6 Advantages of Proposed System

The proposed system has several advantages, including:

Real-time monitoring of waste levels
Reduced labor costs
Increased efficiency in waste collection
Predictive maintenance
Chapter 2: Project Description

2.1 History of Embedded Systems

Chapter 4: Implementation

4.1 Schematic Diagram

The schematic diagram for the proposed system is shown in Figure 4.1. It consists of an ultrasonic sensor, Arduino Uno board, LCD display, and IoT modem.

4.2 Working

Whenever power is supplied to the ultrasonic sensor, it will detect the level of garbage by emitting ultrasonic sound waves that are converted into electrical signals. The Arduino Uno board will process these signals and display the level of garbage on the LCD display. If the garbage level exceeds a certain threshold, the IoT modem will send an alert to the local municipalities through the Blynk IOT app.

4.3 Components Used

The following components are used in the proposed system:

Ultrasonic Sensor
Arduino Uno board
LCD Display
IoT Modem
Chapter 5: Results and Conclusion

5.1 Success Criteria

The proposed system successfully meets the set criteria by providing real-time monitoring of waste levels, reduced labor costs, and increased efficiency in waste collection.

5.2 Conclusion

The IoT-based garbage monitoring and auto-alerting system using ultrasonic sensors is an efficient and effective solution for waste management in urban areas. It reduces the manual effort required in monitoring waste bins, enhances the efficiency of waste collection, and predicts maintenance requirements based on waste levels. This system has the potential to revolutionize the field of waste management and improve the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of waste collection and management processes.Chapter 6: Future Scope

The proposed system can be further enhanced by integrating it with other IoT devices and systems, such as smart waste bins, waste segregation systems, and waste-to-energy conversion systems. This will enable the system to provide more comprehensive waste management solutions and contribute to a more sustainable and eco-friendly urban environment.
